# CA Fluid Simulation in WebGL
This is an implementation of the [2D Liquid Simulator With Cellular Automaton in Unity](http://www.jgallant.com/2d-liquid-simulator-with-cellular-automaton-in-unity/) by Jon Gallant. Jon generously provides a walkthrough of the algorithm and also the Unity / C# [code](https://github.com/jongallant/LiquidSimulator) that implements it. 

I stumbled across this in a Hacker News [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34946877) and just so happen to be interested in putting some time into coding in WebGL again, this seems like a fun and interesting first project.

## Goals

**Practice "working backwards"**

I have in the past had a tendency to very quickly jump in and start coding. With this small project, I am practicing writing these goals and the README.md first, before writing any code. This is such a simple project with such a clear path (laid out in Jon's article) but I still am finding it hard to spend the time visualizing the outcome first.

**Practice sharing my work**

I have really struggled to get myself to share my work over the years. My intention is to share this on my newly created [blog](https://mauricef.gg) and post a link to it on [Hacker News](https://ycombinator.com). I'm not really concerned with how the community recieves this, it's more about the act of sharing something small that I created. I have consumed so much content shared by others and contributed so little back, I'd like to see what it feels like to share, to get over some of the blocks preventing me from contributing.

**Gain some exposure to C# / Unity**  

I haven't read or written C# since around 2006, I also have not used Unity. I think this will be a nice bounded way to understand how modern C# looks and feels while geting some exposure to Unity. Who knows, maybe by the end I'll feel that C# / Unity is a more attractive way to build a system like this versus Javascript / WebGL!

**Improve my WebGL skills** 

I find these "translation" projects to be a nice way to learn. I'm not breaking any new ground, Jon has described all the steps and provided code. This feels like a great way to improve my WebGL with a clear goal in mind.

**Practice working in short sessions**

This *seems* like a project that should take around ten hours of work, I think I can manage to get myself to complete this over the course of a week or two. I am purposfully avoiding putting more than an hour or two into this each day. I have found it hard to sustain that incremental approach in the past but I think it's a real super power I'd like to develop in myself.
