    "# Top Solutions Review\n",
    "\n",
    "A very brief summary of the top solutions outlined in the [closing discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/186290).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tom Van de Wiele\n",
    "\n",
    "[Writeup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/183543)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very complex rules based agent at around 11k LOC. Initially, Tom tried to apply deep rl but found it challenging:\n",
    "\n",
    "> It turns out that the credit assignment part is very hard to get right with an arbitrary number of units (ships/bases), a long episode duration and a dynamic opponent pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "He also commented that an RL solution would require significant compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent computes ship scores (collect halite, return halite, establish a base, attack a base) then the ship scores are converted to ship plans in which each ship is assigned a specific task (attack base at 5,15). This component manages ship priority, avoiding conflicts and coordinating things like returns to base. Finally the plan is executed via a low level action component which contains many optimizations and heuristics.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a rule based bot, implemented as a single ~4900 loc script. The bot is based on \"stateful, long term decision making\" using a concept the author calls \"projects\". There are a set of modular projects for example HuntProject, DefenseShipyardProject, ExpeditionProject, EscortProject. The bot ranks the projects and then allocates ships to different projects, this assignment is sticky in the sense that particular ships are associated with a particular project for many steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uninstall LoL\n",
    "[Writeup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/183727)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a rule-based bot with around 100 hand tuned parameters. It is implemented as a single file around 2500 LOC. The team initially considered RL but had trouble with the 'player-based approach' of Halite. They then used an evolutionary algorithm which worked well initially but they then abandoned in the later parts of the competition due to problems with overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a complex bot that incorporates many strategies, the core strategy is the concept of creating farming regions bounded by three shipyards, the region being in the interior of the triangle formed by the shipyard. Many strategies emerge from that concept such as guarding the region, allowing intruders and then trapping them, farming the halite (allowing it to grow to its max to take advantage of the exponential nature).\n",

    "## Leukocyte\n",
    "[Writeup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/183704)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an ML based agent and also the best ML based agent of this competition. It was trained on replays from top players winning games. It is a conv / mlp based network with some heuristics. It is per ship, meaning that the action probability is calculated for each ship and then some logic is used to select the order in which actions are applied and avoiding conflicting actions (self collision). There are also some constraints based on the phase of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "A separate model is trained for three game phases, opening game, mid game and end game.\n",

    "## mzotkiew\n",
    "[Writeup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/185865)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a single file, ~700 LOC bot. Ships are assigned targets which include surrounding enemy ships carrying halite, defending against enemy ships near a base, collecting halite, moving to a location to spawn a shipyard.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a target assigned, ship movement is calculated based on an \"intention\" calculation which includes things like moving towards a base (+1 intention) and risking a ship (-64 intention). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the code includes exceptions such as pulling all ships back to the shipyard at the end of the game.\n",

    "\n",
    "The teams best bot is trained model (based on Efficient Net / semantic segmentation) to predict ship combined with heuristics for spawning and converting actions. The model is trained with the expected raw features along with a set of hand coded features such as distance to bases, threat estimation of different ships etc. The model uses around 100k game episodes of top agents from the leader board.\n",

    "## Starek\n",
    "[Writeup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/185656)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a two \"layer\" bot in that it computes per ship action scores based on the local environment of each ship and some more goal based, global scores based on the board state. The scores are based on computing hand tuned probability scores for enemy ship moves. These probabilities are then used to compute the best move for each of the bot's ship. There are also algorithms for looking at weighted halite potential and distances to shipyards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global goals states for individual ships involve moving to good mining positions during the early game and attacking enemy ships or yards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author said that choosing the right factors for the algorithms is tricky and could benefit from training / learning. The author also believes that the best strategy is to combine both local and global optimizations in a hierarchy of decision models.\n",

    "This is a [single file](https://gist.github.com/minaminao/cbe4a3d514ea9ae924cb5d59181d78cc) of about 1150 lines of code. The bot is does not use any learned parameters although the team considered using reinforcement learning but felt it would be challenging due to the large action space and because treating each agent as an independent entity (to reduce the action space) would make it difficult to calculate more globally optimal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is split into three phases based on the current time step. The first 100 steps are focused on rapidly generating ships and colleting halite. The steps from 100-300 are focused on attacking opponents and making ships at the expense of limiting halite mining. The closing phase from 300-400 revert to mining and eliminate ship building.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Minimum cost flow\" algorithm is used to assign target cells for ships to mine and for identifying the next move for a ship given a target.\n",

    "## Syncbot\n",
    "[Writeup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/discussion/185626)\n",
    "\n",
    "This bot is implemented as a set of modules split across shipyard conversion, ship movement and spawning with modular sets of heuristics and rules within each area of responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot takes inspiration from https://www.kaggle.com/solverworld/optimus-mine-agent. It uses the \"Hungarian algorithm\" for assigning mining ships to different halite deposits and uses the concept of ship \"roles\" such as miner, attacker, farmer and swarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to hand tuned parameters, the bot also uses genetic algorithms to learn some parameter values and uses an MLP to predict spawn policy based on the performance of top bots such as mzotkiew's bot.\n",

    "\n",
    "This bot is a single python file around 1100 LOC. The bot doesn't appear to use any trained parameters and applies the following strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ships scan neighbors to find the highest halite cell within a four step radius, with a weight factor to prefer closer cells. There is central coordination so that neighboring ships don't choose the same target cell. There are heuristics for deciding how much cargo to store based on how aggressive other players are hunting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to navigate crowded spaces, there are heuristics that evaluate per-ship risk based on distance to enemies and amount of cargo stored. Ships which are at higher risk are given priority when choosing moves during a turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some end game heuristics where zero halite ships will begin hunting after step 300 and the \"end game all-out deposit\" strategy copied from mzotkiew's bot.\n"
