    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a competitive [Kaggle Halite](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite) agent by applying deep reinforcement learning techniques and self-play. The Kaggle Halite competition ended a year ago, without a competative (publicly shared) reinforcement learning based agent. I've worked through several deep RL books and courses and experimented with JAX but I haven't put the pieces together to try to solve a more significant project. Collaboration and contributions welcome!\n",

    "## JAX Implementation\n",
    "I'm using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) as the foundation for the project. The [Halite SDK](https://www.kaggle.com/sam/halite-sdk-overview) works well for building heuristic based agents but is likely too slow to train an RL agent using self-play - the The Python Halite SDK takes about 7 seconds to generate an episode with two random agents while the JAX implementationtakes about 25ms when generating episodes in batch on a Colab GPU.\n"
